'''A Finite State Machine (FSM) engine.

This module implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) engine. In addition to the usual states and transitions, the GWN FSM includes actions, memory, and conditions. 

An action is a user written function executed on a transition, before moving the machine to the next state.

Memory may be any object capable of recording and retrieving information, in whatever access mode the application may need (LIFO, FIFO, etc). The memory facility is not part of the FSM machine, but an independent object. Memory may be handled in the action functions.

A conditions is a user written function or expression which returns True or False when executed or evaluated. The action function and the transition are only executed if the condition evaluates to True. If the condition on a transition evaluates to False, the transition is not performed, and its related action is not executed.

The FSM is defined through tables of transitions. In a current state, for a given input symbol, the process() method uses these tables to decide which action to call and which the next state will be, if and only if the condition evaluates to True; otherwise, nothing happens.

The table of transitions defines the following associations::

        (input_symbol, current_state) --> (action, next_state, condition)

where action is a function, symbols and states can be any objects, and condition is a function or an expression whith returns a boolean. This table is maintained through the FSM methods add_transition() and add_transition_list().

A second table of transitions defines another kind of association::

        (current_state) --> (action, next_state, condition)

This allows to add transitions valid for any input symbol. The table of any symbol transitions is maintained through the FSM method add_transition_any().

The FSM has also one default transition not associated with any specific
input_symbol or state. The default transition matches any symbol on any state, and may be used as a catch-all transition. The default transition is set through the set_default_transition() method. There can be only one default transition.

On receiving a symbol, the FSM looks in the transition tables in the following order::

    1. The transitions table for (input_symbol, current_state).
    2. The transitions table for (current_state), valid for and any input symbol.
    3. The default transition.
    4. If no valid transition is found, the FSM will raise an exception.

Matched transitions with the former criteria may produce a list of (action, next_state, condition). The condition is evaluated for each tuple in the list, and the first tuple on which the condition is found True is executed, the action function is called, and the next state is set as the current state.

If no transition is defined for an input symbol, the FSM will raise an exception. This can be prevented by defining a default transition. 

The action function receives a reference to the FSM as a parameter, hence the action function has access to all attributes in the FSM, such as current_state, input_symbol or memory.

The GWN Finite State Machine implementation is an extension of Noah Spurrier's FSM 20020822, C{http://www.noah.org/python/FSM/}.
