GNU Radio packet

This directory contains .py files generated from GR (GNU Radio) .grc files packet_tx.grc, packet_rx_grc y packet_loopback_hier.grc. These .py files were modified by hand with some small corrections to make them run in GNU Radio 3.9.

The files were obtained by loading the .grc files in GRC (GNU Radio Companion), generating the flowgraphst (.py files), and then correcting these .py files. The .py files were stored by GRC in ~/.grc_gnuradio, and copied here to ensure they will not be inadvertently modified. 

From files packet_tx and packet_rx the following GWN blocks were created:
Parameter versions, all inputs and outputs, all parameters with default values, similar to original GR versions:
  packet_tx_gwn : Packet Tx GWN
  packet_tx_gwn : Packet Rx GWN
Simplified versions, with only one input and one output, and all parameters setted with default values:
  event_tx : Event Tx
  event_rx : Event Rx
These blocks use the concept of "event" in GWN, which may be a string or a dictionary of suitable fields as is usual in network communications (Type, SubType, payload).
