# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project. Your comments, examples, code, will help correct errors, improve functioning, and promote further development.

These notes describe the expected type of contibutions, and the way to carry them on. We expect a kind, respectful communication, as described in the [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) we have adopted for this project.


## Errors

The easiest way to report an error is through an *issue*. In the project's main page you can touch the button *Issues* on the menu upper bar to see subjects already submitted; the button *New Issue* allows to insert a title and a description of a new subject, and the button *Submit new issue* creates a conversation on this new subject.


## Extensions

This project is conceived as a minimal toolkit for teaching or research in wireless data transmission protocols. Hence, extensions are the normal way to use this toolkit. However, we intend to leave this toolkit as such, a general purpose collection of blocks usable in wide contexts. Though new examples and general purpose enhancements are welcome, and may be considered for inclusion in the toolkit, users are encouraged to carry out their own developments as GNU Radio [Out-of-tree modules](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=OutOfTreeModules). This toolkit is free to use according to the [License](LICENSE).
